# IPS Solution

## _Thesis Preparation, PoC Application_

This repository holds the code for an _Android_ application capable of applying a path loss model concept to infer the distance between a device and a BLE Estimote beacon.

By applying this proximity technique, the application takes advantage of the antropological concept of proxemics to calculate the proxemic zone in which the device is from the beacon.

## Workflow

1. The application _IPS Solution_, running on a smartphone compatible with Android Marshmallow, finds the BLE Estimote beacon
2. The application, through the [Android Beacon Library], computes the distance between the smartphone and the beacon
3. The distance is transformed, through a classification process, into a proxemic zone based on the following figure.

## Features

- Proximity classification indoor positioning system in 1 dimension
- Radio propagation model that infers the distance between two objects
- Android application compatible with version Marshmallow

## Example

The following example shows the application running on an ASUS Zenfone Live (Android Marshmallow)
